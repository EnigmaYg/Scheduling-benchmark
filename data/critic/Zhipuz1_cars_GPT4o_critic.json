Task A should be completed first, followed by Task B, leading to a sequential execution model totaling 56 minutes.\n\n**Conflict Design and Tool Verification:**\n\n- **Conflict Design:** \n  - Both tasks need the Wrench simultaneously at different crucial steps.\n  - Task B cannot start or progress effectively until Task A is completed due to Wrench usage.\n\n- **Tool Verification:**\n  - Wrench is in use for almost the entirety of Task A (0-43 mins)\n  - Attempted scheduling results in Wrench conflicts at critical junctures when trying to begin Task B concurrently.\n\nUltimately, the plan reflects a strategic sequencing that respects tool availability while considering step dependencies within each task. Thus, there is acceptance that sequential execution is the only feasible plan under the given constraints without additional tools.",

Ultimately, it showed the complexity in scheduling without any overlaps in tool usage, particularly with the Wrench being a bottleneck.\n\nTo provide a clearer response, let's break down the correct plan, conflict design, and tool verification once more.\n\n**Correct Plan:** \nGiven the constraints and the tools available (only one Wrench, among others), the tasks must be interleaved carefully to avoid tool conflicts:\n\nTask A:\n- **A.1**: Start by disconnecting the battery using the Wrench (2 mins).\n- **A.2**: Next, perform drilling operations (15 mins) after A.1 is complete.\n- **A.3**: Perform another step using the Wrench (5 mins) after Task B's wrench-using steps allow.\n- **A.5**: Use the Wrench again (4 mins) when Task B steps don't occupy it.\n- **A.11**: Finalize using the Wrench (3 mins) after all Task B steps using the Wrench are complete.\n\nTask B:\n- **B.1**: Begin with draining fluids using Pan and Wrench (25 mins).\n- **B.2**: Continue with another wrench-requiring step once A.1 frees it (20 mins).\n- **B.3**, **B.7**, **B.8**: Interleave as gaps in Task A's wrench usage allow.\n\nThe determination was that overlapping tool usage for Wrench, but allowing other tools to be used when not conflicting, would lead to a higher total time but optimal with respect to constraints.\n\n**Conflict Design:** \nThe primary conflict arises from the limited availability of the Wrench, requiring careful scheduling of wrench-dependent steps in both tasks. The constraints necessitate a sequential handling of wrench steps across tasks, with careful planning of non-wrench-dependent steps to maximize parallel execution.\n\n**Tool Verification:**\nThe focus of tool verification is ensuring that, at any given time, no task overlaps on using the same tool simultaneously:\n- Ensure that when Task A uses the Drill, Task B uses other tools.\n- All wrench-dependent steps from Task A must be positioned so they do not overlap in time with wrench-dependent steps from Task B.\n- Verification involves checking each step's tool dependency and ensuring they align with the planned timeline.\n\nGiven that consistent overlapping was adjusted and conflicts in the Wrench usage were prevalent, the endpoint is a longer schedule but feasible under slow sequential processing. \n\nThus, your conclusion is correct: multiple iterations and errors led to a realization that tightly confined tool constraints did lead to a FAIL in some versions. However, would reiterate that allowing sequential completion of all tasks might be feasible, although impractical due to complex overlapping tool constraints.",

Here's a breakdown of the plan that meets the tool conflict, along with the conflict design and tool verification for the steps.\n\n### Conflict Design:\n\n1. **Tool Conflict**:\n   - **Wrench**: Used in:\n     - Task A: A.1 (Remove wheels)\n     - Task B: B.1 (Remove wipers, etc.)\n   - **Paintbrush**: Used in:\n     - Task A: A.4 (Apply primer), A.5 (Apply 3 coats paint)\n     - Task B: B.3 (Apply urethane primer)\n   - **Suction cups**: Used in:\n     - Task B: B.2 (Remove old windshield), B.5 (Slide new windshield)\n\n### Correct Plan Execution:\n\n**Plan Overview**:\n- Total time: 115 minutes.\n- Sequence of Task A and Task B optimized to avoid tool conflicts.\n\n#### Schedule:\n1. **Task B (Install Windshield)**:\n   - **B.1**: 0-15 mins (Wrench, Screwdriver)\n   - **B.2**: 15-35 mins (Suction cups)\n   - **B.3**: 35-65 mins (Paintbrush)\n   - **B.4**: 65-70 mins (Sponge)\n   - **B.5**: 70-88 mins (Suction cups)\n\n2. **Task A (Paint Wheels)**:\n   - **A.1**: 15-35 mins (Wrench)\n   - **A.2**: 35-50 mins (Fine grit sandpaper)\n   - **A.3**: 50-60 mins (Fine grit sandpaper)\n   - **A.4**: 65-70 mins (Paintbrush)\n   - **A.5**: 70-115 mins (Paintbrush)\n\n### Tool Verification:\n\n- **Wrench**\n  - **B.1 (0-15)** uses the Wrench, then becomes available at 15 for **A.1 (15-35)**. No overlap noted.\n  \n- **Paintbrush**\n  - **B.3 (35-65)** uses the Paintbrush, which is required for **A.4 (65-70)**. The Paintbrush is free after B.3 at time 65 and is available to be used for A.4 right after.\n  \n- **Suction cups**\n  - **B.2 (15-35)** uses the Suction cups, which are free after 35 and are not needed in Task A.

Below are the critical conflicts and the proposed correct plan following the resolution of those conflicts.\n\n#### Identified Tool Conflicts\n\n1. **Wrench Usage Conflict**:\n   - Task A Step 1 (A.1): Needs Wrench and Screwdriver.\n   - Task B Step 1 (B.1): Needs Jack and Wrench.\n   - **Conflict**: Both A.1 and B.1 require Wrench at the same time.\n\n2. **Bucket Usage Conflict**:\n   - Task A Steps (A.3 (Bucket, Cloth), A.4 (Bucket), A.5 (Bucket, Cloth)): All require Bucket.\n   - **Conflict**: A.3, A.4, and A.5 cannot be done in parallel as only one Bucket exists.\n\n3. **Cloth Usage Conflict**:\n   - Task A Steps (A.3 (Bucket, Cloth), A.5 (Bucket, Cloth)): Both require Cloth.\n   - **Conflict**: A.3 and A.5 cannot be executed simultaneously.\n\n4. **No Conflicts Detected for**:\n   - Compressor (only in A.6, thus not conflicting with Task B).\n   - Scraper (only in A.2).\n   - Stiff Brush (only in B.3).\n\n### Correct Plan\n\n#### Proposed Sequence of Steps:\n\n**Plan 1 - Optimal Schedule**:\n- **Time 0-10**: A.2 (Scraper)\n- **Time 10-30**: A.3 (Bucket, Cloth) \n- **Time 0-15**: B.1 (Jack, Wrench)\n- **Time 15-17**: B.2 (None)\n- **Time 17-27**: B.3 (Stiff Brush)\n- **Time 30-35**: A.4 (Bucket)\n- **Time 35-43**: A.5 (Bucket, Cloth)\n- **Time 43-47**: A.6 (Compressor)\n\n#### Tool Verification\n\n1. **Wrench**: Used only during B.1 (0-15), allowing A.2 and A.3 to run sequentially (10-30).\n2. **Bucket**: Available only post A.3. A.4 and A.5 are scheduled sequentially without conflict because A.4 follows A.3, and A.5 uses it after A.4 completes.\n3. **Cloth**: Does not introduce conflicts, as A.3 (10-30) and A.5 (35-43) are run in a staggered schedule. The periods where both A.3 and A.5 could theoretically overlap are avoided by proper timing (A.3 before B.1 takes precedence).\n4. **Other tools**: Use of Scraper, Compressor, and Stiff Brush do not conflict, as they are isolated to singular steps.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe proposed optimal plan efficiently minimizes the total execution time to 47 minutes while addressing and avoiding tool conflicts thoroughly. The tool verification checks ensure that each tool's usage complies with the constraints without any overlapping or contention among tasks.",

    "How To Prevent Rust on Your Car_1+How To Remove Old Decals_0": "Based on the provided reasoning and analysis of the tasks A and B, here's a structured output that includes the necessary conflict design and tool verification for the plans:\n\n### Conflict Design\nConflicts arise when two or more steps require the same tools at overlapping times. The identified conflicts are as follows:\n\n1. **Bucket Conflict**: \n   - Steps: A.1 (0-15) and B.1 (15-20) both require Bucket.\n   \n2. **Sponge Conflict**: \n   - Steps: A.1 (0-15) and B.1 (15-20) both require Sponge.\n\n### Correct Plan\nTo resolve the conflicts and efficiently manage the tasks, the correct plan is:\n\n- **Execution Sequence**:\n  1. A.1 (0-15) \u2013 Bucket, Hose, Sponge\n  2. A.2 (15-20) \u2013 Hose (parallel with)\n  3. B.1 (15-20) \u2013 Bucket, Sponge\n  4. B.2 (20-22) \u2013 Cloth\n  5. A.3 (20-30) \u2013 Microfiber cloth\n  6. B.3 (22-23) \u2013 None\n  7. B.4 (23-27) \u2013 Dryer\n  8. B.5 (27-29) \u2013 Cloth\n  9. A.4 (30-50) \u2013 Microfiber cloth\n  10. B.6 (29-37) \u2013 None\n\n### Tool Verification\n- After the execution of A.1 (0-15), both the Bucket and the Sponge are free at 15, allowing B.1 to begin without conflict. The Hose remains in use for A.2 (15-20), which does not overlap with B.1 since B.1 only requires the Bucket and Sponge.\n  \n- At 20, B.1 finishes, allowing B.2 (using Cloth) to commence, which does not overlap with A.3 (using Microfiber cloth) since they require different tools.\n\n- B.3 does not require any tools, so it can be scheduled without conflict. \n\n- B.4 uses the Dryer (available) while A.3 is still executing, since they are independent of A's tool requirements.\n\n- B.5, which uses Cloth, is scheduled after B.4 and does not conflict with any other tasks as A.4 (starting at 30) uses Microfiber cloth, which is different.\n\n- The final step, B.6, occurs while A.4 is executing, but since it does not utilize any tools, there are no conflicts.\n\n### Summary\nThe total duration for the tasks, calculated as per the execution order, is **50 minutes**. This approach optimizes the use of tools while ensuring all tasks are completed without conflicts. The final timeline structure maintains clarity on the sequence and the tool usage, confirming the efficiency of the execution.",

The primary conflict arises from the shared usage of the Wrench, which is critical for multiple steps across both tasks. \n\n### Identifying Tool Conflicts\n\n1. **Wrench Conflict**: \n   - **Steps using Wrench**:\n     - Task A: A.1, A.2, A.3, A.7, A.8\n     - Task B: B.1, B.2, B.3, B.4\n   - Since both processes require the Wrench at the same time, they cannot overlap.\n\n2. **Cherry Picker Conflict**:\n   - Only used in Task A (A.4, A.5, A.6), which means while this tool is in use, the Wrench can be used for steps in Task B.\n\n### Conflict Design\n\nTo create a feasible schedule that minimizes total time while respecting the Wrench conflicts, we will prioritize available steps that do not use Wrench before switching to those that require it.\n\n#### Proposed Plan Sequences\n\n1. **Plan 1**: \n   Begin with Task B entirely after utilizing Wrench for Task A\u2019s initial steps that do not conflict. The sequence would focus on completing all Wrench-dependent tasks in blocks, separated by steps using Cherry Picker. \n\n   - **Total Step Sequence**:\n     - A.1 (25 mins, Wrench)\n     - B.1 (15 mins, Wrench, Jack) **(after A.1 during free time)**\n     - A.2 (20 mins, Wrench, Screwdriver)\n     - B.2 (20 mins, Wrench, Jack) **(after A.2 during free time)**\n     - A.3 (18 mins, Wrench)\n     - B.3 (5 mins, Wrench) **(at this point, only B.3 can occur before more A steps)**\n     - B.4 (4 mins, Wrench)\n     - A.4 (10 mins, Cherry Picker) **(now continuing with A)**\n     - A.5 (15 mins, Cherry Picker)\n     - A.6 (12 mins, Cherry Picker)\n     - A.7 (22 mins, Wrench)\n     - A.8 (25 mins, Wrench, Screwdriver)\n     - A.9 (17 mins, Funnel)\n\n### Tool Verification\n- **Verification of Wrench Usage**:\n  - After A.1 (25 mins), the Wrench is freed for B.1 and so forth, allowing for linear progression post A.3, which does occur before Task A completely resolves all steps requiring the Wrench.\n\n- **Cherry Picker Usage**:\n  - In steps A.4, A.5, A.6 where Cherry Picker is used, the Wrench is free.\n  \n- Total expected time for this planned sequence is optimal at **208 minutes**, mixing dependent steps from both tasks while maintaining non-conflict tool use.\n\n#### Correct Plan Summary\nThe selected plan starts with A.1 and allows for B tasks to fit in where dependencies allow, ensuring all steps are completed with the least time utilizing Wrench. The scheduling ensures we interleave Cherry Picker tasks where the Wrench is not in use, minimizing total time to be **208 minutes** with well-defined usage of tools. \n\nThus, the planning adapts to conflict constraints, successfully aligning tool dependencies to execute efficiently.",

Steps are neatly sequenced to avoid overlapping tool use.\n\nThis structured approach ensures clarity and delineates the constraints imposed by tool usage while providing an effective plan for executing both tasks within the minimal time frame while respecting the availability of tools.",

Below is the correct plan based on your scheduling, along with conflicts and tool verification.\n\n### Correct Plan:\n1. **Time 0-4:** A.1 (Cloth)\n2. **Time 0-4:** B.1 (Dryer)\n3. **Time 4-6:** B.2 (Dryer and Dental floss)\n4. **Time 5-9:** A.2 (Scissors)\n5. **Time 6-11:** B.3 (Scissors and Dental floss)\n6. **Time 9-11:** A.3 (Sponge)\n7. **Time 11-12:** A.4 (No tool)\n8. **Time 12-15:** A.5 (No tool)\n\n### Tool Conflicts:\n1. **Conflicts involving Scissors:**\n   - A.2 (5-9) uses Scissors.\n   - B.3 (6-11) uses Scissors.\n   - **Conflict design:** A.2 must complete before B.3 starts. Therefore, B.3 cannot begin until A.2 is finished, which is at 9.\n\n2. **Conflicts involving Dryer:**\n   - B.1 (0-4) uses Dryer.\n   - B.2 (4-6) also uses Dryer.\n   - **Conflict design:** B.2 must start after B.1 completes since they both require the Dryer. Therefore, B.2 starts immediately at 4 after B.1 is finished.\n\n3. **Dental Floss Usage:**\n   - B.2 (4-6) uses Dental Floss.\n   - B.3 (6-11) also uses Dental Floss.\n   - **Conflict design:** Similar to the Scissors, B.3 cannot start until B.2 is finished, which is at 6.\n\n### Tool Verification:\n- **At time 0-4:**\n  - Cloth is used by A.1.\n  - Dryer is used by B.1. \n  - There's no overlap in tools, so this is valid.\n\n- **At time 4-5:**\n  - A.1 is finishing (Cloth), while B.2 (Dryer and Dental floss) is starting. There is no conflict as they use different tools.\n\n- **At time 5-6:**\n  - Scissors (A.2) runs concurrently with Dryer (B.2); however, B.2 is using the Dryer which is not in conflict with A.2 using Scissors. Therefore, this is valid.\n\n- **At time 6-9:**\n  - A.2 (Scissors) is still running until 9 while B.3 (Scissors and Dental floss) cannot start until A.2 finishes. Thus, no tool conflict here.\n\n- **At time 9-14:**\n  - B.3 (Scissors and Dental floss) runs from 9 to 14 while A.3 (Sponge) runs from 9 to 11.\n  - There are no conflicting tools, as Sponge is exclusive to A.3.\n\n- **At time 11-12:**\n  - A.4 runs without tools, causing no conflicts.\n\n- **At time 12-15:**\n  - A.5 runs without tools, also causing no conflicts.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe plan successfully adheres to the tool constraints and allows scheduling of tasks in a manner that adheres to the dependencies of each task without tool conflicts, resulting in a total time of **15 minutes**.",

The critical path, specifically the Wrench's simultaneous demand poses the main conflict, which has been addressed through strategic scheduling ensuring that the Wrench is not shared concurrently between tasks.

Here's how we can configure this plan, along with conflict design and tool verification for the steps that could be completed:\n\n### Conflict Assessment\n- **Task A (Clean the Tires)** requires:\n  1. Spray tire cleaner (Spray bottle)\n  2. Soak (no tools)\n  3. Scrub with stiff brush (Stiff brush)\n  4. Rinse with pressure washer and hose (Pressure washer, Hose)\n\n- **Task B (Clean Leather Interior)** requires:\n  1. Spray degreaser (Spray bottle)\n  2. Scrub with medium bristle brush (Requires tool not available)\n  3. Wipe with microfiber cloth (Microfiber cloth)\n  \n### Conflict Identification\n- The **tool conflict** arises from the need to use the **Spray bottle** for both tasks at the same time (for Task A step 1 and Task B step 1).\n- The **Stiff brush** is also a conflict point since it is needed for Task A step 3 and potentially for Task B step 2 if the stiff brush is considered suitable (though the instructions specify a medium bristle brush).\n\n### Proposed Plan\n1. **Start Task A first to use the Spray bottle:**\n   - Step 1: **Spray tire cleaner** using the Spray bottle (Task A)\n2. **After completing Task A step 1, proceed with Task A:**\n   - Step 3: **Scrub with Stiff brush** (Task A)\n3. **Complete rinsing with Pressure washer and Hose:**\n   - Step 4: **Rinse** with Pressure washer and Hose (Task A)\n\n4. **In the next available sequence, start Task B after Task A is complete:**\n   - Step 1: **Spray degreaser** using the Spray bottle (Task B)\n   - Step 3: **Wipe using Microfiber cloth** (Task B)\n\n### Correct Plan\n- Task A steps: 1, 3, 4 \n- Followed by Task B steps: 1, 3 (Note: Task B step 2 cannot be performed due to tool unavailability).\n\n### Tool Verification\n- **Tool x (Spray bottle)**: \n  - Completes Task A step 1, then not in use during Step 3 and 4, and can be used again for Task B step 1 after Task A is fully complete.\n- **Stiff brush**: \n  - Used only during Task A step 3. Task B step 2 cannot be completed.\n- **Pressure washer** and **Hose**: \n  - Used in Task A step 4 after Task A step 1 and step 3 are completed.\n- **Microfiber cloth**: \n  - Utilized in Task B only after Task A is completely finished.\n  \n### Summary\nThis plan is designed to mitigate the tool conflict while executing as many steps as possible from both tasks under the constraints of tool availability. It provides a clear order of operation and segregates tool usage appropriately to ensure no two tasks are using the same tool at the same time.

No other task requires it simultaneously.\n\n3. **Other Tools**: \n   - Scraper used in B.2 (15-25), Bucket and Cloth used in B.3 (25-45), Bucket again in B.4 (45-50), and combined Bucket and Cloth in B.5 (50-58) with no overlapping use with Wrench and Stiff brush in Task A.\n\n4. **Compressor Verification**: \n   - Used only once in B.6 (58-62) without any overlaps.\n\n### Total Time Calculation\n\n- **Total time for Task A**: 28 minutes (from A.1 to A.8)\n- **Total time for Task B**: 62 minutes (from B.1 to B.6)\n- **Final Overall Time**: 62 minutes (max of 62 for Task B since it runs longer than Task A).\n\nIn conclusion, the execution plan avoids tool conflicts and each tool is utilized without overlap. The total sequence is feasible and adheres to the rules of tool usage, resulting in an efficient plan for completing both tasks in 62 minutes.",

The key conflicts arise primarily from the usage of the Cloth and Polisher.\n\n### Identified Conflicts:\n1. **Cloth usage**:\n   - Task A:\n     - A.3 (Blot) - 3 min \n     - A.4 (Wipe with soap/water) - 5 min\n   - Task B:\n     - B.4 (Rub until invisible) - 8 min\n\n   The Cloth is required in A.3 and A.4 sequentially, while it is also required in B.4, leading to a direct tool conflict if the timings overlap.\n\n2. **Polisher usage**:\n   - Task B:\n     - B.2 (Apply compound to polisher) - 1 min\n     - B.3 (Apply compound to surface) - 2 min\n\n   The Polisher is used for B.2 and B.3 consecutively, so there is no overlapping conflict within task B, but it cannot be used for any other task while these steps are executing.\n\n### Correct Plan:\n\nThe correct sequencing needs to ensure that Cloth can be used in the necessary steps without overlapping conflicts. Here\u2019s a feasible execution plan based on the analysis:\n\n1. **A.1** (0-4 min): Plastic knife  \n2. **A.2** (4-6 min): Sponge  \n3. **B.1** (4-9 min): Ultra-fine sandpaper  \n4. **A.3** (6-9 min): Cloth  \n5. **A.4** (9-14 min): Cloth  \n6. **B.2** (14-15 min): Polisher  \n7. **B.3** (15-17 min): Polisher  \n8. **B.4** (17-25 min): Cloth  \n\n### Total Time:\n- The total time taken will thus be **25 minutes**.\n\n### Tool Verification:\n- **Plastic knife**: Used only in A.1 from 0-4 (free afterwards).\n- **Sponge**: Used only in A.2 from 4-6 (free afterwards).\n- **Cloth**: \n  - Used in A.3 from 6-9 (free after 9).\n  - Used in A.4 from 9-14. \n  - Used in B.4 from 17-25 (cleaning steps).\n- **Ultra-fine sandpaper**: Used in B.1 from 4-9 (free afterwards).\n- **Polisher**: \n  - Used in B.2 from 14-15 (free after).\n  - Used in B.3 from 15-17 (free after).\n\n### Conflict Design:\n- The only conflicts which were managed are:\n  - **Cloth**: A.3 and A.4 could be executed before B.4 begins (conflict resolved by ensuring A.4 is completed before B.4 starts).\n  - The Polisher was not conflicting with any steps since it only executed after Task A was finished.\n\nThus, all steps are scheduled correctly without overlapping tool usage, and all tools are used optimally, maintaining the necessary sequencing to avoid conflicts. \n\nIn summary, the final output, encompassing the planned steps, their timings, tools used, and total time taken is encapsulated and aligns with the problem's requirements.",

    "How To Replace a Muffler_0+How To Replace a Bike Tube_0": "### Analysis of Heuristic Reasoning:\n\nThe reasoning provided clearly identifies the conflict created by limited tool availability while attempting to schedule two simultaneous tasks (Task A: Replace Muffler and Task B: Replace Bike Tube). \n\n#### Conflict Identification:\n- The **Wrench** tool is the source of primary conflicts because both Task A and Task B have multiple steps that require it:\n  - Task A: Steps 2 (15 min) and 6 (8 min) both use the Wrench.\n  - Task B: Steps 3 (2 min), 4 (1 min), and 12 (3 min) also require the Wrench.\n  \n- The **Lever** and **Pump** tools are also important but less critical because they each have fewer steps associated with them in Task B. However, they still create dependencies that need to be considered.\n\n### Correct Plan:\n1. **Start both tasks simultaneously:**\n   - Task A.1 (Park vehicle) takes 2 min.\n   - Task B.1 (Shift gear) takes 0.5 min, followed by Task B.2 (Turn bike upside down) which takes 0.75 min.\n\n2. **As the tasks progress:**\n   - After Task A.1 (ends at 2 min), begin Task A.2 (Remove old muffler using Wrench for 15 minutes from 2 to 17 min).\n   - During the Wrench's usage by Task A, Task B must wait for the Wrench and thus is idle until Task A.2 finishes. \n\n3. **After Task A.2 is complete (at 17 min):**\n   - Schedule Task B.3 (Loosen axle nuts with Wrench for 2 min) from 17 to 19 min, then Task B.4 (Pull wheel with Wrench for 1 min) from 19 to 20 min.\n   - Task B can then execute B.5 (Deflate tire) for 1 min from 20 to 21 min without tools.\n\n4. **Continue with Task A and Task B:**\n   - Task A.3 (Slide hanger for 4 min) takes place from 17 to 21 min.\n   - Task B.6 (Pry outer tire with Lever for 2 min) occurs from 21 to 23 min while Task A.4 (Coat with sealant using Spray for 1 min) takes place from 21 to 22 min.\n   - Task B.7 (Remove tube with Lever for 3 min) takes place from 23 to 26 min after completing B.6.\n   - Task B.8 (Inflate tube using Pump for 1 min) can be paused until you're not using the Lever and proceeds next. \n\n5. **Complete Remaining Steps:**\n   - Continue completing Tasks A and B sequentially while tracking tool availability, ensuring when one task requires a tool, you cease overlapping on it with the other task, and ensuring no waiting times from being idle.\n\n### Tool Verification:\n1. **Wrench**: \n   - Used in Task A.2 (2-17), then free at 17.\n   - Task B.3 (17-19) and Task B.4 (19-20) use Wrench, and then Task A.6 (27-35) requires the Wrench. \n   - Task B.12 (Wrench from 38 to 41) only begins after A.6 has ended (35), ensuring no conflicts.\n\n2. **Spray Bottle**: \n   - Task A.4 uses it for 1 minute from 21 to 22 without conflicts, as it's unoccupied by Tool B at that time.\n\n3. **Lever**:\n   - Task B.6 (21-23), B.7 (23-26) has no conflicts as they occur while the Wrench and Spray are not in use.\n  \n4. **Pump**:\n   - Lastly, B.8 (Inflate tube at 26-27) and subsequently B.11 (Fill tube from 36-38) do not conflict with any tool usage, maintaining availability.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe overall scheduling of both tasks can be optimized through effective interleaving of task steps according to tool availability, leading to a total time of **41 minutes** for Task B to complete after task A's maximum action tracks. This method avoids tool conflicts, efficiently manages tool usage, and schedules the phases effectively.",

Specifically:\n  - Task A uses the Hose in steps A.1, A.2, A.3, A.5.\n  - Task B uses the Hose in step B.1.\n  \n- The **Paintbrush** is exclusively used in Task B and does not conflict with Task A.\n\n#### Key Points:\n1. Only the **Hose** is a point of contention due to its usage in both tasks.\n2. **Paintbrush** and the other tools (Stiff brush, Microfiber cloth, Soft brush, Spray bottle, etc.) do not create conflicts with each other.\n\n### Correct Plan Outline\nTo resolve the tool conflict, we need to outline a plan that utilizes the **Hose** efficiently:\n\n1. **Start Task B**:\n   - **B.1 (0-15)**: Use **Pressure washer** and **Hose**. (Hose is in use)\n   \n2. **After B.1 Completes**:\n   - **A.1 (15-19)**: Use **Hose**. \n   - **A.2 (19-21)**: Use **Hose**, **Spray bottle**.\n   - **A.3 (21-26)**: Use **Hose**, **Spray bottle**, **Soft brush**.\n   - **A.4 (26-34)**: Use **Stiff brush**.\n   - **A.5 (34-37)**: Use **Hose**.\n   - **A.6 (37-43)**: Use **Microfiber cloth**.\n\n3. **Meanwhile Task B Continues**:\n   - **B.2 (15-60)**: Use **Coarse grit sandpaper**.\n   - **B.3 (60-80)**: Use **Paintbrush**.\n   - **B.4 (80-110)**: Use **Paintbrush**.\n   - **B.5 (110-130)**: Use **Fine grit sandpaper**.\n   - **B.6 (130-160)**: Use **Paintbrush**.\n   - **B.7 (160-180)**: Use **Fine grit sandpaper**.\n\n### Final Execution Timeline\nCombining the steps from both tasks while respecting the tool conflicts, we would achieve the following timeline:\n\n1. B.1 (0-15): Pressure washer, Hose.\n2. A.1 (15-19): Hose.\n3. A.2 (19-21): Hose, Spray bottle.\n4. A.3 (21-26): Hose, Spray bottle, Soft brush.\n5. A.4 (26-34): Stiff brush.\n6. A.5 (34-37): Hose.\n7. A.6 (37-43): Microfiber cloth.\n8. B.2 (15-60): Coarse grit sandpaper.\n9. B.3 (60-80): Paintbrush.\n10. B.4 (80-110): Paintbrush.\n11. B.5 (110-130): Fine grit sandpaper.\n12. B.6 (130-160): Paintbrush.\n13. B.7 (160-180): Fine grit sandpaper.\n\n### Total Time Verification\n- Task B takes a total of 180 minutes.\n- Task A takes 43 minutes and can execute within the timeframe of Task B.\n- Therefore, the total execution time is 180 minutes, driven by the longer duration of Task B.\n\nThis plan avoids tool conflicts and allows for the sequential use of shared tools while still working efficiently within the available time.",
    "How To Fix a Flat Tire_0+How To Clean a Car Engine_0": "To identify and analyze the tool conflicts, extract the relevant plans, and provide the conflict design and tool verification, we can summarize the findings based on the reasoning content provided:\n\n### Conflict Identification\nThe primary conflict arises from the use of the wrench, which is needed in both Task A and Task B. The specific steps that create these conflicts are:\n\n- **Task A Steps:** \n  - A.4: Turn wheel and unscrew valve (1 min, Wrench)\n  - A.5: Attach sealant nozzle (3 mins, Wrench)\n\n- **Task B Steps:** \n  - B.2: Disconnect battery (2 mins, Wrench)\n\n### Correct Plan\nGiven the identified conflicts, here\u2019s the correct sequence to manage the tasks while ensuring tool availability:\n\n1. **Start Task A.1** (Inspect tire) from 0-4 minutes (no tools required).\n2. **Start Task A.2** (Inflate tire) from 4-6 minutes (uses Pump).\n3. **Start Task A.3** (Remove objects) from 6-11 minutes (uses Pliers).\n4. **Start Task A.4** (Use wrench to turn wheel and unscrew valve) from 11-12 minutes.\n5. **Start Task B.2** (Use wrench to disconnect battery) from 12-14 minutes.\n6. **Resume Task A.5** (Attach sealant nozzle) from 14-17 minutes (uses Wrench).\n7. **Start Task A.6** (Drive) from 17-19 minutes (no tools required).\n8. **Continue Task B.3** (Remove debris) from 19-23 minutes (no tools required).\n9. **Continue Task B.4** (Apply degreaser) from 23-26 minutes (uses Spray).\n10. **Continue Task B.5** (Soak) from 26-31 minutes (no tools required).\n11. **Continue Task B.6** (Scrub) from 31-39 minutes (uses Stiff brush).\n12. **Complete Task B.7** (Rinse) from 39-44 minutes (uses Hose).\n\n### Total Time\nThe total execution time for both tasks while avoiding tool conflicts: **44 minutes**.\n\n### Tool Verification\n- **Wrench Usage:**\n  - Used in A.4 (11-12) and A.5 (14-17) \n  - B.2 (12-14) uses wrench.\n  - As per the schedule, no two steps required the wrench at the same time, as A.5 starts after B.2 has concluded.\n\n- **Other Tools:**\n  - **Pump:** Used only in A.2 (no conflict)\n  - **Pliers:** Used only in A.3 (no conflict)\n  - **Spray bottle:** Used only in B.4 (no conflict)\n  - **Stiff brush:** Used only in B.6 (no conflict)\n  - **Hose:** Used only in B.7 (no conflict)\n\n### Conflict Design\n- **Tool Conflicts:**\n  - The only conflict arises with the Wrench, which must be used sequentially across tasks A and B. The selected schedule respects the constraints imposed by tool availability and ensures no overlapping use, thus resolving potential conflicts effectively.\n\nThis structured approach to resolving tool conflict while scheduling concurrent tasks provides clarity and efficiency in task management. Total execution time was minimized while adhering to tool constraints, confirming that the plan is both efficient and meets the required functional outcomes.",
    "How To Fix a Flat Tire_0+How To Install a Windshield_0": "### Heuristic Reasoning Analysis\n\nThe tasks involve fixing a flat tire (Task A) and installing a windshield (Task B). The tools available pose a conflict particularly with the Wrench and Suction Cups, which need to be scheduled carefully to avoid overlaps.\n\n### Tool Conflicts Identified\n\n1. **Wrench Conflicts**:\n   - Task A requires Wrench for steps A.4 (15-16) and A.5 (16-19).\n   - Task B requires Wrench for step B.1 (0-15).\n   - Hence, Wrench can only be used by one task at a time.\n\n2. **Suction Cups Conflict**:\n   - Task B requires Suction Cups for steps B.2 (15-35) and B.5 (70-88).\n   - Suction Cups cannot be used simultaneously by multiple steps.\n\n### Correct Plan\n\nWe would outline the correct sequence of steps and verify the tool usage:\n\n1. **Plan Sequence**:\n   - A.1 (0-4) [no tools] - Task A starts\n   - B.1 (0-15) [Wrench, Screwdriver] - Task B starts concurrently\n   - A.2 (4-6) [Pump] - Task A, uses Pump\n   - A.3 (6-11) [Pliers] - Task A, uses Pliers\n   - **Wait** from (11-15) for Wrench (Task A cannot proceed)\n   - A.4 (15-16) [Wrench] - Task A proceeds as B.1 is completed\n   - B.2 (15-35) [Suction Cups] - Task B starts using Suction Cups\n   - A.5 (16-19) [Wrench] - Task A continues\n   - A.6 (19-21) [no tools] - Task A completes\n   - B.3 (35-65) [Paintbrush] - Task B continues\n   - B.4 (65-70) [Sponge] - Task B continues\n   - B.5 (70-88) [Suction Cups] - Task B finishes\n\n### Summary of the Conflict Design and Tool Verification\n\n#### Conflict Design:\n- **Wrench Usage**: \n  - Task A's steps requiring Wrench (A.4 and A.5) are dependent on B.1's completion since they cannot overlap.\n- **Suction Cups Usage**: \n  - B.2 and B.5 both use Suction Cups but are scheduled sequentially without overlaps since both occur in different periods of the timeline.\n\n#### Tool Verification:\n- **Wrench**:\n  - B.1 (0-15) uses it firstly, after which A.4 (15-16) and A.5 (16-19) complete using the Wrench with no overlapping conflicts.\n- **Suction Cups**:\n  - B.2 (15-35) and B.5 (70-88) are scheduled in a manner that respects the tool's single-usage constraint.\n- **Other tools**: Utilize tools that only one task requires at a time without overlap.\n\n### Total Time Verification\nThe total execution time for both tasks is **88 minutes**, after accounting for all steps and resolving conflicts via careful sequencing.\n\nIn conclusion, the finalized task schedule confirms effective sequenced execution without tool conflicts, ensuring both tasks are completed efficiently.",

Task B requires a Soft brush, Microfiber cloth, Sponge, and Paintbrush.\n\nWe have the following tools available: Sponge (1), Microfiber cloth (1), Soft brush (1), Paintbrush (1).\n\nSince we have only one Sponge, we can't use it for both tasks at the same time. However, we can use the Microfiber cloth for both tasks. The Soft brush and Paintbrush are only used in Task B.\n\nLet's create a plan that uses the available tools efficiently.\n\n1. Start with Task A.1: Apply a silver dollar-sized amount of wax on a foam applicator or damp sponge. (Time: 1 minute(s)) (Tools: Sponge)\n2. Task A.2: Apply the wax evenly over a small section of the car at a time using gentle, overlapping circular motions. (Time: 15 minute(s)) (Tools: Sponge)\n3. Task A.3: Allow the car to sit for a few minutes until the wax is ready to come off. (Time: 5 minute(s)) (Tools: None)\n4. Task A.4: Wipe away the wax in a circular motion using a microfiber cloth to give the car a smooth finish. (Time: 20 minute(s)) (Tools: Microfiber cloth)\n5. Task B.1: Clean the stained area with a mild soap solution and a soft-bristled brush to remove any loose debris. (Time: 5 minute(s)) (Tools: Soft brush)\n6. Task B.2: Rinse the area thoroughly with water to remove any soap residue. (Time: 2 minute(s)) (Tools: None)\n7. Task B.3: Dry the area completely with a microfiber cloth. (Time: 3 minute(s)) (Tools: Microfiber cloth)\n8. Task B.4: Apply a stain-removing product specifically designed for egg stains to the affected area. (Time: 1 minute(s)) (Tools: Sponge)\n9. Task B.5: Let the product sit for the recommended amount of time, usually 10-15 minutes. (Time: 12 minute(s)) (Tools: None)\n10.

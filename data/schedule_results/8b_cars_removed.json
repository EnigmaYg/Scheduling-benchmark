However, we need to be mindful of the time required for each task and the tools' availability.\n\nLet's start by allocating the tools:\n\n1. Task A requires a spoon, which is available. We can start Task A first.\n2. Task B requires abrasive blasting equipment, which is also available. We can start Task B at the same time as Task A.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nA.1 (start at 0, end at 5) Tool: Spoon\nB.1 (start at 0, end at 5) Tool: Abrasive blasting equipment\nA.2 (start at 5, end at 9) Tool: Cloth\nB.2 (start at 5, end at 20) Tool: Abrasive blasting equipment\nA.3 (start at 9, end at 24) Tool: Baking soda\nB.3 (start at 20, end at 35) Tool: Chemical solvent\nA.4 (start at 24, end at 26) Tool: Vacuum\nB.4 (start at 35, end at 43) Tool: Coarse grit sandpaper\nA.5 (start at 26, end at 29) Tool: Dry cleaning solvent\nB.5 (start at 43, end at 55) Tool: Compressed air sprayer\nB.6 (start at 55, end at 67) Tool: Oven\n\nHowever, we need to adjust the plan because Task A requires a dry cleaning solvent, but we don't have it. We can allocate the dry cleaning solvent to Task A after Task B is completed.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\nA.1 (start at 0, end at 5) Tool: Spoon\nB.1 (start at 0, end at 5) Tool: Abrasive blasting equipment\nA.2 (start at 5, end at 9) Tool: Cloth\nB.2 (start at 5, end at 20) Tool: Abrasive blasting equipment\nA.3 (start at 9, end at 24) Tool: Baking soda\nB.3 (start at 20, end at 30) Tool: Chemical solvent\nB.4 (start at 30, end at 38) Tool: Coarse grit sandpaper\nA.4 (start at 24, end at 26) Tool: Vacuum\nB.5 (start at 38, end at 50) Tool: Compressed air sprayer\nA.5 (start at 50, end at 53) Tool: Dry cleaning solvent\nB.6 (start at 50, end at 62) Tool: Oven\n\nHowever, we still have a problem. Task A requires a dry cleaning solvent, but it's allocated to Task B. We can't allocate the dry cleaning solvent to Task A because it's not available. Therefore, we can't complete both tasks concurrently.\n\nHowever, we can complete Task A first and then start Task B.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nA.1 (start at 0, end at 5) Tool: Spoon\nA.2 (start at 5, end at 9) Tool: Cloth\nA.3 (start at 9, end at 24) Tool: Baking soda\nA.4 (start at 24, end at 26) Tool: Vacuum\nA.5 (start at 26, end at 29) Tool: Dry cleaning solvent\nB.1 (start at 29, end at 34) Tool: Abrasive blasting equipment\nB.2 (start at 34, end at 49) Tool: Abrasive blasting equipment\nB.3 (start at 49, end at 59) Tool: Chemical solvent\nB.4 (start at 59, end at 67) Tool: Coarse grit sandpaper\nB.5 (start at 67, end at 79) Tool: Compressed air sprayer\nB.6 (start at 79, end at 91) Tool: Oven\n\n[Total time: 91 minutes]\n\nTherefore, the optimal plan is to complete Task A first and then start Task B.",

Task B requires the following tools: Air die grinder, Stone bit attachment, Compressor, Roller, and Knife.\n\nWe have a limited number of tools, but we can use some tools for both tasks. The critical path is the sequence of steps that determines the minimum time required to complete the tasks.\n\nLet's analyze the critical path:\n\n1.

Since we have only one Jack and one Air die grinder, we can start Task A and Task B simultaneously, but we need to allocate the Jack and Air die grinder accordingly.\n\n2.

Meanwhile, we can start Step B.2 (Buff the cleaned area with a stone bit attachment) with the Stone bit attachment.\n\n3. After Step A.2, we can start Step A.3 (Snap off the old brake pads) with the Pliers. Meanwhile, we can start Step B.3 (Remove any debris with compressed air) with the Compressor.\n\n4. After Step A.3, we can start Step A.4 (Apply anti-seize lubricant on the metal contact edges and on the back of the new brake pads) with the Pliers. Meanwhile, we can start Step B.4 (Apply vulcanizing cement to the buffed area) with the Air die grinder.\n\n5. After Step A.4, we can start Step A.5 (Insert the new brake pads in the same position) with the Pliers. Meanwhile, we can start Step B.5 (Push the pointy side of the tire patch through the hole so the sticky surface is inside the tire) with the Pliers.\n\n6. After Step A.5, we can start Step B.6 (Push air bubbles out of the patch with a roller) with the Roller.\n\n7.

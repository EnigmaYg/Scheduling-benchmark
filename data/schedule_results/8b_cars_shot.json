However, the cloth is used in different steps of the two tasks.

We can see that Task A requires a Wrench and Pliers, while Task B also requires a Wrench and Pliers. However, Task A requires a Jack, which is not needed for Task B.\n\nSince we have only one Jack, we can start Task A first. We can remove the wheel (A.1) and then use the Jack to remove the caliper (A.2). After that, we can use the Wrench to snap off the old brake pads (A.3). Then, we can use the Pliers to insert the new brake pads (A.5).\n\nNow, let's analyze Task B. We can start by inspecting the tire (B.1), which requires no tools. Then, we can inflate the tire (B.2) using the Pump. Next, we can remove any objects from the tire (B.3) using the Pliers.

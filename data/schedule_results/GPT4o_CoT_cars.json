The last step finishes at minute 43.\n\n**[Total time: 43 minutes]**\n\nThis plan resolves the conflicts by scheduling steps independently based on the available tools and aiming for minimal completion time.",
    "How To Remove Grease and Oil From a Car's Interior_1+How To Clean Leather Interior_0": "To determine if both tasks can be completed concurrently, we must evaluate the tool availability and the timeline of steps for each task.\n\n### Tool Availability:\n- Spoon (1)\n- Cloth (1) \u2014 Note that Task B requires this tool multiple times.\n- Vacuum (1)\n- Sponge (1)\n- Vacuum cleaner (1)\n- Soft brush (1)\n- Stiff brush (1)\n\n### Task Analysis:\n1. Evaluate task dependencies and tool requirements to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Conflict Analysis:\n- **Cloth Usage Conflicts:** \n  - Task A's step A.2 (Blot with cloth, 4 min) is concurrent with Task B's step B.1 (Wipe down with cloth, 5 min), and Task B's steps B.4 (Wipe down, 5 min) and B.5 (Dry with cloth, 6 min).\n  - Both tasks require cloth, which is a limited tool.\n  \n### Conflict Resolution:\n- To resolve conflict, tasks needing the cloth must be sequential, not concurrent.\n- Cloth can only be used sequentially for steps needing cloth.\n\n### Efficient Plan Execution:\nImplement one continuous timeline with effective tool allocation.\n\n#### Detailed Step Schedule:\n- **A.1 and B.3 do not conflict,** as they use Spoon and Stiff brush respectively.\n- **No tool conflicts between vacuum steps:** A.4 with Vacuum and B.2 with Vacuum cleaner + Soft brush.\n\n#### Proposed Schedule:\nStart with Task A, sequentially fit Task B around cloth availability.\n\n1. **A.1**: (Start at minute 0, end at minute 5) Tool Spoon\n2. **B.3**: (Start at minute 0, end at minute 8) Tool Stiff brush\n3. **B.1**: (Start at minute 8, end at minute 13) Tool Cloth\n4. **A.2**: (Start at minute 13, end at minute 17) Tool Cloth\n5. **A.3**: (Start at minute 17, end at minute 32) No Tool Needed\n6. **A.4**: (Start at minute 32, end at minute 34) Tool Vacuum\n7. **B.2**: (Start at minute 34, end at minute 38) Tool Vacuum cleaner + Soft Brush\n8. **A.5**: (Start at minute 38, end at minute 41) Tool Sponge\n9. **B.4**: (Start at minute 41, end at minute 46) Tool Cloth\n10. **B.5**: (Start at minute 46, end at minute 52) Tool Cloth\n\n#### Total Time: 52 minutes\n\nThis sequence addresses potential cloth conflicts and optimizes the concurrent use of other available tools. While individual steps overlap as little as possible for cloth usage, the rest integrate naturally within the timeframe available."

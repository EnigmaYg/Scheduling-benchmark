Remove tire (No tool, 2 mins)\n\n### Tools Available\n- Wrench (4)\n- Screwdriver (2)\n- Cloth (1)\n- Jack (1)\n\n### Schedule Plan\nBy scheduling tasks based on the availability of tools:\n\n1. **A.1** (Start at minute 0, end at minute 4) Tool: Wrench\n2. **B.1** (Start at minute 0, end at minute 5) Tool: Wrench\n3. **B.2** (Start at minute 5, end at minute 9) Tool: Jack\n4. **A.2** (Start at minute 4, end at minute 10) Tool: Screwdriver\n5. **B.3** (Start at minute 9, end at minute 11) Tool: Wrench\n6. **A.3** (Start at minute 10, end at minute 15) Tool: Screwdriver\n7. **B.4** (Start at minute 11, end at minute 12) Tool: None\n8. **B.5** (Start at minute 12, end at minute 14) Tool: None\n9. **A.4** (Start at minute 15, end at minute 23) Tool: None\n10. **A.5** (Start at minute 23, end at minute 25) Tool: Cloth\n11. **A.6** (Start at minute 25, end at minute 26) Tool: None\n12. **A.7** (Start at minute 26, end at minute 28) Tool: None\n13. **A.8** (Start at minute 28, end at minute 31) Tool: None\n14. **A.9** (Start at minute 31, end at minute 37) Tool: None\n15. **A.10** (Start at minute 37, end at minute 40) Tool: Wrench\n\n### Total Time\nThe maximum overlap in tasks considering tool availability leads to a total time of 40 minutes:\n\n- Task A: Sequential implementation from start to end with intermediate steps where Task B proceeds.\n- Task B: Interleaving where no tool from Task B is needed in Task A step.\n\nThis plan effectively utilizes the tools and schedules both tasks concurrently in the minimum total time of 40 minutes. \n\n**Conclusion**: Both tasks can be completed concurrently as planned.",
    "How To Fix a Low Beam Headlight_0+How To Clean Fuel Injectors_0": "To determine if both tasks can be completed concurrently, let's evaluate the tool requirements and schedule both tasks in parallel. We have the following tools available:\n\n- Wrench (5)\n- Screwdriver (2)\n- Cloth (1)\n- Cleaning kit (2)\n\n### Task Breakdown:\n#### Task A: Fix a Low Beam Headlight\n1. A.1: Wrench (4 min)\n2. A.2: Screwdriver (6 min)\n3. A.3: Screwdriver (5 min)\n4. A.4: None (8 min)\n5. A.5: Cloth (2 min)\n6. A.6: None (1 min)\n7. A.7: None (2 min)\n8. A.8: None (3 min)\n9. A.9: None (6 min)\n10. A.10: Wrench (3 min)\n\n#### Task B: Clean Fuel Injectors\n1. B.1: Wrench (10 min)\n2. B.2: None (5 min)\n3. B.3: Wrench (8 min)\n4. B.4: Cleaning kit (12 min)\n5. B.5: None (2 min)\n6. B.6: None (7 min)\n7. B.7: Cleaning kit (3 min)\n8. B.8: Wrench (15 min)\n\n### Tool and Step Scheduling:\nBoth tasks can proceed concurrently due to the sufficient availability of tools, especially the wrench, which is the most used tool. \n\nHere is the proposed plan:\n\n- A.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 4) Tool: Wrench\n- B.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 10) Tool: Wrench\n- A.2 (start at minute 4, end at minute 10) Tool: Screwdriver\n- B.2 (start at minute 10, end at minute 15) Tool: None\n- A.3 (start at minute 10, end at minute 15) Tool: Screwdriver\n- B.3 (start at minute 15, end at minute 23) Tool: Wrench\n- A.4 (start at minute 15, end at minute 23) Tool: None\n- B.4 (start at minute 23, end at minute 35) Tool: Cleaning kit\n- A.5 (start at minute 23, end at minute 25) Tool: Cloth\n- A.6 (start at minute 25, end at minute 26) Tool: None\n- A.7 (start at minute 26, end at minute 28) Tool: None\n- A.8 (start at minute 28, end at minute 31) Tool: None\n- B.5 (start at minute 35, end at minute 37) Tool: None\n- B.6 (start at minute 37, end at minute 44) Tool: None\n- A.9 (start at minute 31, end at minute 37) Tool: None\n- B.7 (start at minute 44, end at minute 47) Tool: Cleaning kit\n- A.10 (start at minute 37, end at minute 40) Tool: Wrench\n- B.8 (start at minute 47, end at minute 62) Tool: Wrench\n\n### Total Time Calculation:\n- Task A: 40 minutes\n- Task B: 62 minutes\n\nThe total time to complete both tasks concurrently is the maximum time taken by either task since some steps overlap: **62 minutes**.\n\n[Total time: 62 minutes]"

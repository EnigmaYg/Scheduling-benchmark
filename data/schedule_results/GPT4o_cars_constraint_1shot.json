The plan is organized so that during periods when Task B must pause (due to drying, etc.), Task A uses the paint brushes. Here's the optimal schedule:\n\n- **B.3 and A.4** do not overlap since they both require paintbrushes and Task B's primer dry period accommodates this without interference.\n\nAs you've sorted the steps logically according to tool availability, the total time will be the max end time of any step:\n\n- Task A ends at minute 95.\n- Task B ends at minute 40.\n\nThus, since Task A takes longer, overall completion time will be aligned with the longest task:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total time: 95 minutes} \\]",

The plan is structured to ensure steps execute without tool conflict. Here's the optimal sequence:\n\n**Schedule:**\n\n- Start both tasks at time 0 (minutes):\n  \n1. A.1 (start at 0, end at 4) Wrench  \n2. B.1 (start at 0, end at 10) Wrench  \n\n- Utilize the screwdriver for Task A:\n\n3. A.2 (start at 4, end at 10) Screwdriver  \n4. A.3 (start at 10, end at 15) Screwdriver  \n\n- Continue Task B with another wrench and cleaning kit:\n\n5. B.3 (start at 10, end at 18) Wrench  \n6. B.4 (start at 10, end at 22) Cleaning kit  \n\n- Process steps without tools in parallel:\n  \n7. A.4 (start at 15, end at 23) None  \n8. A.5 (start at 23, end at 25) Cloth  \n9. A.6 (start at 23, end at 24) None  \n10. A.7 (start at 24, end at 26) None  \n11. A.8 (start at 26, end at 29) None  \n\n- B.2 (start at 10, end at 15) None  \n- B.5 (start at 22, end at 24) None  \n- B.6 (start at 24, end at 31) None  \n\n- Next step requiring cleaning kit:\n  \n12. B.7 (start at 22, end at 25) Cleaning kit  \n\n- Final step overlaps with earlier actions using a wrench:\n  \n13. B.8 (start at 31, end at 46) Wrench  \n\nComplete Task A with reconnecting the battery:\n\n14. A.9 (start at 29, end at 35) None  \n15. A.10 (start at 35, end at 38) Wrench  \n\n[A minimum total time: 46 minutes] \n\nThis plan optimizes using all tools available frequently without delays due to tool shortages, achieving minimal total operation time.",
    "How To Fix a Low Beam Headlight_0+How To Replace Ball Joints_1": "To determine if both tasks can be completed concurrently and efficiently, we need to analyze the steps and the tool availability for each task:\n\n**Task A: Fix a Low Beam Headlight**\n1. **A.1** Disconnect the car battery. (Tools: Wrench)\n2. **A.2** Remove trim. (Tools: Screwdriver)\n3. **A.3** Remove the headlight. (Tools: Screwdriver)\n4. **A.4** Disconnect wires. (Tools: None)\n5. **A.5** Remove debris. (Tools: Cloth)\n6. **A.6** Insert new bulb. (Tools: None)\n7. **A.7** Connect wiring. (Tools: None)\n8. **A.8** Put bulb assembly back. (Tools: None)\n9. **A.9** Reinstall trim pieces. (Tools: None)\n10. **A.10** Reconnect battery. (Tools: Wrench)\n\n**Task B: Replace Ball Joints**\n1. **B.1** Remove wheel. (Tools: Jack, Wrench)\n2. **B.2** Remove control arm. (Tools: Wrench, Jack)\n3. **B.3** Install new joint. (Tools: Wrench)\n4. **B.4** Grease new joint. (Tools: Grease gun, Wrench)\n\n**Tool Availability:**\n- Wrench: 6\n- Screwdriver: 2\n- Cloth: 1\n- Jack: 2\n- Grease gun: 1\n\nSteps from Task A and B requiring the same tools need to be scheduled ensuring availability. Here's the optimal plan:\n\n1. **A.1** (start at 0, end at 4) Wrench\n2. **B.1** (start at 0, end at 15) Jack, Wrench\n3. **A.2** (start at 4, end at 10) Screwdriver\n4. **B.2** (start at 15, end at 35) Wrench, Jack\n5. **A.3** (start at 10, end at 15) Screwdriver\n6. **A.4** (start at 15, end at 23) None\n7. **A.5** (start at 23, end at 25) Cloth\n8. **A.6** (start at 25, end at 26) None\n9. **A.7** (start at 26, end at 28) None\n10. **A.8** (start at 28, end at 31) None\n11. **A.9** (start at 31, end at 37) None\n12. **A.10** (start at 37, end at 40) Wrench\n13. **B.3** (start at 35, end at 40) Wrench\n14. **B.4** (start at 40, end at 44) Grease gun, Wrench\n\n[Total time: 44 minutes]\n\nBoth tasks can be completed concurrently with the given tools, achieving optimal efficiency in scheduling."

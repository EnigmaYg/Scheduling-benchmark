    "How To Replace Bike Pedals_0+How To Change a Car Engine_0": "To determine whether both Task A and Task B can be completed concurrently with the available tools, we need to identify any overlapping tool requirements and schedule the tasks around the limited number of tools. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Analysis:\n**Task A (Bike Pedal Replacement) Tool Requirements:**\n- **Wrench** is needed for all four steps. \n \n**Task B (Car Engine Change) Tool Requirements:**\n1. **Pan** for draining the fluids.\n2. **Cherry Picker** for lifting the engine.\n3. **Funnel** for adding coolant and oil to the engine.\n4. **Socket Set** is unlimited and can be used if assumed for disconnecting lines, removing and replacing bolts.\n\n### Tool Constraints:\n- 1 Wrench\n- 1 Pan\n- 1 Cherry Picker\n- 1 Funnel\n\n### Scheduling Plan:\n- **Wrench** is needed for Task A, while **Pan**, **Cherry Picker**, and **Funnel** are needed for specific steps in Task B.\n\nGiven these constraints, the strategy involves scheduling Task A (using the Wrench) and Task B (using other tools) without overlap in Wrench use. Here's an optimal task scheduling:\n\n1. **B.1:** (start at minute 0, end at minute 25) Pan\n2. **B.2:** (start at minute 25, end at minute 45) [No specific tool needed; assume socket set is used]\n3. **B.3:** (start at minute 45, end at minute 63) [No specific tool needed; assume socket set is used]\n4. **B.4:** (start at minute 63, end at minute 73) Cherry Picker\n5. **B.5:** (start at minute 73, end at minute 88) Cherry Picker\n6. **B.6:** (start at minute 88, end at minute 100) Cherry Picker\n7. **B.7:** (start at minute 100, end at minute 122) [No specific tool needed; assume socket set is used]\n8. **B.8:** (start at minute 122, end at minute 147) [No specific tool needed; assume socket set is used]\n9. **B.9:** (start at minute 147, end at minute 164) Funnel\n\n**While Task B is progressing, Task A can be simultaneously started at any point when the wrench becomes available. Thus Task A should fill in the gaps:**\n\n- **A.1:** (start at minute 0, end at minute 4) Wrench\n- **A.2:** (start at minute 4, end at minute 8) Wrench\n- **A.3:** (start at minute 8, end at minute 10) [No specific tool needed]\n- **A.4:** (start at minute 10, end at minute 16) Wrench\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The tasks can be completed efficiently within 164 minutes without overlapping the usage of the Wrench needed for Task A and adhering to the schedule for Task B.\n\n[Total time: 164 minutes]\n\nThis plan effectively utilizes the limited Wrench while concurrently working on various parts of Task B, making sure tools don\u2019t overlap.",

However, Task B's steps must be coordinated as follows:\n\n### Task Breakdown and Scheduling:\n\n#### Task A: To Install a Car Starter\n- **A.1:** Disconnect the car\u2019s battery and the wiring to the starter using a wrench. (10 mins)\n- **A.2:** Remove the old starter. (8 mins)\n- **A.3:** Slide the new starter into place. (4 mins)\n- **A.4:** Secure the new starter onto the mounting bracket with bolts. (9 mins)\n- **A.5:** Reconnect the wiring to the starter. (7 mins)\n- **A.6:** Attach the cables to the car\u2019s battery. (5 mins)\n\n#### Task B: To Replace Ball Joints\n- **B.1:** Remove the wheel. (15 mins) - Requires Jack\n- **B.2:** Remove the lower control arm. (20 mins) - Continues using the jack\n- **B.3:** Slide the new joint into place. (5 mins) - Continue using tools for assembly, but does not require jack now\n- **B.4:** Pump the new joint full of grease. (4 mins) - Requires Grease Gun\n\n### Scheduling Plan:\nSince Task A and Task B can proceed in parallel without overlapping tool needs, we can start both tasks simultaneously.\n\n1. **A.1** (start at minute 0, end at minute 10) - No tool conflict\n2. **B.1** (start at minute 0, end at minute 15) - Using Jack\n3. **A.2** (start at minute 10, end at minute 18) - Continues Task A\n4. **B.2** (start at minute 15, end at minute 35) - Continues using Jack\n5. **A.3** (start at minute 18, end at minute 22) - Continues Task A\n6. **A.4** (start at minute 22, end at minute 31) - Continues Task A\n7. **B.3** (start at minute 35, end at minute 40) - Free from Jack now\n8. **A.5** (start at minute 31, end at minute 38) - Continues Task A\n9. **B.4** (start at minute 40, end at minute 44) - Using Grease Gun\n10. **A.6** (start at minute 38, end at minute 43) - Continues Task A\n\n### Total Time:\n- Both tasks will overlap, but all steps will be completed by **minute 44**.\n\nHere is the execution plan in order with time allocation and tools used:\n```\nA.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 10) No tool conflict\nB.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 15) Jack\nA.2 (start at minute 10, end at minute 18) No tool conflict\nB.2 (start at minute 15, end at minute 35) Jack\nA.3 (start at minute 18, end at minute 22) No tool conflict\nA.4 (start at minute 22, end at minute 31) No tool conflict\nB.3 (start at minute 35, end at minute 40) No tool conflict\nA.5 (start at minute 31, end at minute 38) No tool conflict\nB.4 (start at minute 40, end at minute 44) Grease gun\nA.6 (start at minute 38, end at minute 43) No tool conflict\n```\n[Total time: 44 minutes]",
    "How To Install a Car Starter_0+How To Clean Fuel Injectors_0": "To determine whether both tasks can be completed concurrently, we need to analyze the tool requirements, especially considering the limitation of having only one cleaning kit. Additionally, we need to assess the time steps for both Task A and Task B.\n\n**Tasks and Tool Analysis:**\n\n- Task A (Install a Car Starter) doesn't require the cleaning kit at any step, utilizing tools like a wrench for disconnecting and reconnecting battery and wiring, but it doesn't depend on the limited tool.\n  \n- Task B (Clean Fuel Injectors) requires the cleaning kit for steps 4 and 7, which means these steps must be executed separately from Task A or else they must be scheduled sequentially.\n\nSince Task A does not require the cleaning kit, and Task B doesn't overlap in time in steps requiring other tools, both tasks can theoretically be run concurrently except for the sequential handling of steps in Task B requiring the cleaning kit. Therefore, we need to ensure the cleaning kit is available when Task B steps 4 and 7 are performed.\n\n**Optimal Scheduling Plan:**\n\n1. **Task A:**\n   - A.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 10) Tool: Wrench\n   - A.2 (start at minute 10, end at minute 18) Tool: None\n   - A.3 (start at minute 18, end at minute 22) Tool: None\n   - A.4 (start at minute 22, end at minute 31) Tool: None\n   - A.5 (start at minute 31, end at minute 38) Tool: Wrench\n   - A.6 (start at minute 38, end at minute 43) Tool: None\n  \n2. **Task B:**\n   - B.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 10) Tool: None\n   - B.2 (start at minute 10, end at minute 15) Tool: None\n   - B.3 (start at minute 15, end at minute 23) Tool: None\n   - **B.4 (start at minute 23, end at minute 35) Tool: Cleaning kit (critical time overlap managed)**\n   - B.5 (start at minute 35, end at minute 37) Tool: None\n   - B.6 (start at minute 37, end at minute 44) Tool: None\n   - **B.7 (start at minute 44, end at minute 47) Tool: Cleaning kit**\n   - B.8 (start at minute 47, end at minute 62) Tool: None\n\nIn this plan:\n- Steps B.4 and B.7 use the cleaning kit and occur during periods when Task A does not require specialized tools.\n- Task B is staggered after Task A for cleaning kit usage (23-35 & 44-47), efficiently managing time without tool overlap.\n\n**Result:**\n\nThe tasks can be completed concurrently utilizing the available tools efficiently by managing the cleaning kit's usage. The total time to complete both tasks is 62 minutes, as Task B, with its longest duration step, dictates the overall end time.\n\n[Total time: 62 minutes]",

We'll analyze the tool requirements for each step, then look for opportunities to perform steps concurrently.\n\n### Task A: To Fix a Low Beam Headlight\n- Step A.1: Disconnect battery (Screwdriver)\n- Step A.2: Remove trim (Screwdriver)\n- Step A.3: Remove headlight (Screwdriver)\n- Step A.4: Disconnect wires (Screwdriver)\n- Step A.5: Remove debris (Cloth)\n- Step A.6: Slide new bulb (No tool needed)\n- Step A.7: Connect wiring (Screwdriver)\n- Step A.8: Put bulb assembly (Screwdriver)\n- Step A.9: Reinstall trim pieces (Screwdriver)\n- Step A.10: Reconnect battery (Screwdriver)\n\n### Task B: To Clean a Car Engine\n- Step B.1: Remove debris (Cloth)\n- Step B.2: Disconnect battery (Screwdriver)\n- Step B.3: Cover electronics (Cloth)\n- Step B.4: Apply degreaser (Spray bottle)\n- Step B.5: Soak degreaser (No tool needed)\n- Step B.6: Scrub grime (Stiff brush)\n- Step B.7: Rinse engine (Hose)\n\n### Tool Allocation Analysis:\nWe have limited tools and need to make sure each step has access to the required tool. The screwdriver is required for multiple steps in Task A and one step in Task B. We need to prioritize it because there is only one available.\n\n#### Concurrent Task Planning:\nWithin each task, plan the steps sequentially, while considering concurrent execution:\n\n**Concurrent Execution Possibilities:**\n- A.1 and B.1 both need a cloth, but since each task starts with different tools, we can start with B.1 (Cloth) while A.1 uses the Screwdriver.\n- A.5 (Cloth) can overlap with B.1 removing debris using a Cloth.\n- After completing Cloth-required steps, prioritize screwdriver steps.\n\n### Schedule\nThe schedule below details the tool allocation:\n\n```\nA.1 (start at minutes 0, end at minutes 4) Tool: Screwdriver \nB.1 (start at minutes 4, end at minutes 14) Tool: Cloth \nA.2 (start at minutes 4, end at minutes 10) Tool: Screwdriver \nA.3 (start at minutes 10, end at minutes 15) Tool: Screwdriver \nB.2 (start at minutes 15, end at minutes 17) Tool: Screwdriver \nA.4 (start at minutes 17, end at minutes 25) Tool: Screwdriver \nA.5 (start at minutes 25, end at minutes 27) Tool: Cloth \nB.3 (start at minutes 27, end at minutes 31) Tool: Cloth \nB.4 (start at minutes 31, end at minutes 34) Tool: Spray bottle \nB.5 (start at minutes 34, end at minutes 39) No tool needed\nA.6 (start at minutes 39, end at minutes 40) No tool needed \nA.7 (start at minutes 40, end at minutes 42) Tool: Screwdriver \nB.6 (start at minutes 39, end at minutes 47) Tool: Stiff brush \nA.8 (start at minutes 42, end at minutes 45) Tool: Screwdriver \nB.7 (start at minutes 47, end at minutes 52) Tool: Hose \nA.9 (start at minutes 45, end at minutes 51) Tool: Screwdriver \nA.10 (start at minutes 51, end at minutes 54) Tool: Screwdriver \n```\n\n**Total time: 54 minutes**\n\nThis schedule methodically allocates tools for concurrent task execution while minimizing delays and optimizing the use of limited resources.",
    "How To Fix a Low Beam Headlight_0+How To Clean Rotors_0": "To determine whether it's possible to complete both tasks concurrently, we must consider the tool availability and time requirements for each step. Let's analyze the tool usage and time allocation step-by-step:\n\n**Tools Analysis:**\n1. **Screwdriver:** Needed for Task A steps such as disconnecting and reconnecting components.\n2. **Cloth:** Could be useful for cleaning purposes in Task A step 5, but not strictly necessary as debris removal may not require it.\n3. **Jack:** Needed for Task B to lift the car.\n4. **Stiff brush:** Needed for Task B step 3 to clean rotors.\n\n**Task Scheduling:**\n- The screwdriver will not be needed for any steps in Task B, so its primary use is in Task A.\n- The jack is only required in Task B steps 1 and indirectly supports step 2.\n- The stiff brush is only required for Task B step 3.\n\n**Optimal Plan Proposal:**\n\n1. **Task A:** Start with steps that don't require the jack or the stiff brush.\n   - (Screwdriver in use)\n     - A.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 4) Screwdriver\n     - A.2 (start at minute 4, end at minute 10) Screwdriver\n     - A.3 (start at minute 10, end at minute 15) None\n     - A.4 (start at minute 15, end at minute 23) Screwdriver\n     - A.5 (start at minute 23, end at minute 25) None\n     - A.6 (start at minute 25, end at minute 26) None\n     - A.7 (start at minute 26, end at minute 28) None\n     - A.8 (start at minute 28, end at minute 31) None\n     - A.9 (start at minute 31, end at minute 37) Screwdriver\n     - A.10 (start at minute 37, end at minute 40) Screwdriver\n\n2. **Task B:** Can begin concurrently with Task A, as long as the jack and stiff brush are not required when the screwdriver is needed.\n   - (Jack in use)\n     - B.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 15) Jack\n   - B.2 (start at minute 15, end at minute 17) None \n   - (Stiff brush in use)\n     - B.3 (start at minute 17, end at minute 27) Stiff brush\n\n**Total Time Calculation:**\nBoth tasks can be completed concurrently without interference because they use different tools at different stages.\n\nThe last step finishes at minute 40. The most time-consuming sequence is Task A (40 minutes) as all the steps can begin after Task B starts.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nA.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 4) Screwdriver\nB.1 (start at minute 0, end at minute 15) Jack\nA.2 (start at minute 4, end at minute 10) Screwdriver\nA.3 (start at minute 10, end at minute 15) None\nB.2 (start at minute 15, end at minute 17) None \nA.4 (start at minute 15, end at minute 23) Screwdriver\nB.3 (start at minute 17, end at minute 27) Stiff brush\nA.5 (start at minute 23, end at minute 25) None\nA.6 (start at minute 25, end at minute 26) None\nA.7 (start at minute 26, end at minute 28) None\nA.8 (start at minute 28, end at minute 31) None\nA.9 (start at minute 31, end at minute 37) Screwdriver\nA.10 (start at minute 37, end at minute 40) Screwdriver\n[Total time: 40 minutes]\n```\n\nAll steps accounted for within concurrent task constraints.

    "How To Fix a Low Beam Headlight_0+How To Remove Lug Nuts and Tires_0": "To determine whether both tasks can be completed concurrently with the given tools, we need to evaluate each step and tool requirement. Let's first review the steps in each task and their tool requirements:\n\n---\n\n**Task A: Fix a Low Beam Headlight**\n- **A.1** Disconnect the car battery (No specific tool mentioned, assume can be done manually).\n- **A.2** Remove the trim (No specific tool mentioned, assume can be done manually).\n- **A.3** Remove the headlight assembly (Assume may not need tools or same tools as others).\n- **A.4** Disconnect the wires (Assume may use hand).\n- **A.5** Remove debris (Use Cloth).\n- **A.6** Slide the new bulb (No specific tool mentioned).\n- **A.7** Connect the wiring pigtail (No specific tool mentioned).\n- **A.8** Put the bulb assembly back (No specific tool mentioned).\n- **A.9** Reinstall trim pieces (No specific tool mentioned).\n- **A.10** Reconnect the battery (No specific tool mentioned).\n\n**Tools Available for Task A**: 1 Screwdriver, 1 Cloth\n\n---\n\n**Task B: Remove Lug Nuts and Tires**\n- **B.1** Loosen the lug nuts (Tire iron or wrench, neither listed as a tool; assume screwdriver or imagination required here).\n- **B.2** Jack up the car (Use Jack).\n- **B.3** Unscrew the lug nuts (Tire iron or wrench, neither listed).\n- **B.4** Remove the lug nuts (Tire iron or wrench, neither listed).\n- **B.5** Remove the tire (No specific tool mentioned, manual).\n\n**Tools Available for Task B**: 1 Jack, Implied need of a wrench/tire iron, not available.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Tool Constraint**: Lack of available wrench/tire iron is a critical constraint as multiple steps in Task B require it. Neither a screwdriver nor a cloth can replace a tire iron effectively.\n- **Step Compatibility**: Both tasks imply simultaneous action might require the same or unavailable tool (i.e., there's no satisfactory tool replacement for certain steps in Task B).\n\nGiven these tool constraints, Task B cannot proceed due to the lack of the essential tire iron or wrench tool. Therefore, concurrent completion of both tasks is not feasible with the current tool inventory.\n\n**Conclusion**: \n\n```\nFAIL\n```",
